# Note Taker by Alex Cook

When the note taker is opened, then the user is presented with a landing page that directs them to a notes page. Once on the notes page, people can create, delete, and store notes. They can also click on an old note to pull up old notes.

This app helps people save and keep track of events to their work day. The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. People can save their events via the time blocks on the app. Once the save button is selected, the event is saved in local storage and will remain even after the page is refreshed. Moreover, when people view the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
